# Crop Yield Forecasting using MLP

This project was completed as part of a Full Stack AI Bootcamp. It involves using machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict crop yield and assess the risk of crop failure due to climate change.

##  Objectives

- **Regression**: Predict crop yield in tons/hectare.
- **Classification**: Categorize yield into Low, Medium, and High.

##  Files Included

- `MLP_Crop_Yield_Model.ipynb` – Full Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Project_Report.pdf` – Detailed report explaining the objective, data, model, results, and insights.

##  Technologies Used

- Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, SHAP

##  Key Highlights

- Used MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for both regression and classification
- Feature engineering with categorical encoding and standard scaling
- SHAP used for model interpretability
- Evaluation with MSE, classification report, and visualizations

## Status

Completed  
Ready for portfolio and submission
